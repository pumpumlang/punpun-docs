# PunPun 1.4.5 language reference

PunPun is a statically typed compiled language. PPC's default backend emits
portable C; direct x86-64 and register-bytecode backends use the same semantic
frontend. This page describes the stable 1.0 language as implemented by PunPun
1.4.5. The older `launch: ... done` dialect remains accepted for migration.

## Program structure

```punpun
bring std::io;

fn twice(value: i64 = 21) -> i64 {
    return value * 2;
}

launch {
    say(twice());
    say(twice(value: 10));
}
```

Files use `.pp`, comments start with `//`, blocks use braces, and statements end
with semicolons. A complete executable has one `launch` block. Imported module
paths use `::`.

## Bindings and core types

```punpun
let name: text = "PunPun";
let mut count: i64 = 1;
count = count + 1;
```

`let` is immutable and `let mut` permits reassignment. Current built-in types
include `i64`, `f64`, `bool`, `text`, `nums`, `void`, safe references `&T` and
`&mut T`, raw pointers `*T`, concrete objects/structs, and typed async tasks.
There are no implicit numeric or text conversions.

Function, constructor, and method calls support positional arguments, named
arguments, and literal default values. Positional arguments must precede named
arguments. A parameter without a default cannot follow one with a default.

## Functions and control flow

```punpun
fn classify(value: i64) -> text {
    if value > 10 {
        return "large";
    } else {
        return "small";
    }
}

launch {
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < 3 {
        say(classify(i));
        i += 1;
    }
}
```

Conditions are `bool`. Integer arithmetic is checked. Calls and operands are
evaluated left-to-right; `and` and `or` short-circuit. Non-void functions must
conservatively return a value on every path.

Functions are first-class values in 1.4.5. A `fn(T) -> R` value may name a
module function or a non-capturing function literal. Sequence `for` loops walk
`nums`, `List<T>`, and `Slice<T>` and lower through the same indexed-loop path
used by every backend.

## Objects, structs, and contracts

```punpun
contract Named {
    fn name() -> text;
}

object User meets Named {
    private let label: text;

    public init(label: text) {
        self.label = label;
    }

    public fn name() -> text {
        return self.label;
    }
}

launch {
    let user = User(label: "Ada");
    say(user.name());
}
```

Objects have identity-oriented runtime storage. Structs are value-oriented.
Fields and methods can be public or private. Contracts provide compile-time
conformance and may be used as value and list element types. Contract calls use
runtime object type identity; the current comparison-chain dispatch is linear
in the number of implementors at that call site.

## References, raw pointers, move, and drop

```punpun
fn bump(value: &mut i64) {
    *value += 1;
}

launch {
    let mut value = 41;
    bump(&mut value);

    unsafe {
        let pointer: *i64 = &raw value;
        *pointer += 1;
    }

    let mut first = User("Ada");
    let second = move(first);
    drop(second);
    first = User("Grace");
}
```

Safe references participate in the compiler's borrow and escape checks. Raw
pointer creation, dereference, and arithmetic require `unsafe`. `move` transfers
an owned object or `nums` value, and subsequent use is rejected until a mutable
binding is reinitialized. `drop` deterministically releases a supported owned
value. Full lexical drop insertion and production lifetime analysis remain
future work.

## Async tasks

```punpun
async fn work(value: i64) -> i64 {
    if cancelled() {
        return 0;
    }
    return value;
}

launch {
    let task = work(42);
    say(await task);
}
```

Async calls create native tasks. `await` is valid in `async fn` and `launch`.
`cancel(task)`, `task_done(task)`, and `cancelled()` provide cooperative
cancellation and completion inspection. See [language/async.md](language/async.md).

## Native injection and FFI

`extern native fn` declarations bridge PunPun calls to explicitly injected C,
C++, Rust, or assembly blocks. Injection is compiled only by `build`/`run`, is
content-addressed and cached, and is never evaluated by `check` or the language
server. See [injection/README.md](injection/README.md).

## Diagnostics and current boundaries

The frontend uses source spans and stable diagnostic codes. `pp explain CODE`
shows extended guidance. `pp emit-hir`, `pp emit-ir`, and `ppc emit-machine-ir` expose typed HIR, verified MIR, and target-aware Machine IR for compiler work.

The distribution also includes a PunPun-written fixed-point compiler for the
documented bootstrap subset. Run `make selfhost` or use
`pp selfhost input.pp output.c`; see [`selfhost/README.md`](../selfhost/README.md).

The 0.6 language foundation executes inferred and explicit generic calls,
deterministically monomorphizes generic types and methods, checks algebraic
enum patterns for reachability/exhaustiveness, and supports `Option<T>`,
`Result<T,E>`, postfix `?`, ownership/borrow checks and lexical destruction for
supported owning values. PunPun 1.4.5 lowers all three backends from PPC's typed
HIR and verified MIR. Contract-typed dynamic dispatch and non-capturing
first-class functions are implemented; capturing closures remain later work.
The authoritative implementation summary is
in [`COMPLETION_REPORT.md`](../COMPLETION_REPORT.md).

Normative 0.6 rules and implementation status are in [`spec/0.6/`](../spec/0.6/).

## 0.6 ownership and slices

Identity objects are move-only. `move(value)` explicitly transfers a binding and `drop(value)` ends it immediately. The compiler also tracks maybe-moved values across branch joins and rejects later use. Normal scope exits destroy supported live move-only object values once.

`nums` intentionally retains its 0.5 shared-handle behavior in 0.6. Use `view(values, start, end)` to create a checked `Slice<int>`; `slice_len(view)` and `slice_get(view, index)` access it. The compiler prevents checked mutation/move of the source while a named slice borrow is live.

## Compiler backends

`--backend=c` is the default and covers the full language.
`--backend=native` emits x86-64 System V assembly directly.
`--backend=bytecode` runs register bytecode in the bundled VM without an
external toolchain. Unsupported backend features produce a diagnostic rather
than silently changing program behavior.


## Structured task groups (0.8+)

PunPun task groups provide an explicit lifetime/control surface around existing async tasks. Create a group with `task_group()`, add tasks with `task_group_add`, then wait, query, cancel or close the group. Cancellation remains cooperative: workers observe cancellation at safe points such as `sleep_ms` or explicit `cancelled()` checks. See [`docs/language/structured-async.md`](language/structured-async.md).
